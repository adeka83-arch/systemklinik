COMPLETED: Removed signature sections from treatment invoice and receipt templates.

Changes made:
1. Created new TreatmentPrintTemplates.tsx with signature-free templates
2. Updated TreatmentsWithDiscount.tsx to use new templates
3. Both invoice and receipt templates now only show clinic info, cashier name, and thank you message without doctor/patient signatures

The print templates are now clean and professional without signature areas.
